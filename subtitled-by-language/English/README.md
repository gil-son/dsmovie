Hello devs, how are you?


This project started at the seventh event of <a href="https://devsuperior.com.br">DevSuperior</a>, where the purpose was to create a film catalog, with evaluation and registration.

After the event, I created in this same project a movie titles API in some languages. This made the project more interactive and accessible with 4 languages.

It's done? Achieved the purpose, but more ideas may arise.


If you want to develop the project and/or understand it better, access the folders (organized in parts).
